When you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address. Your computer then uses that IP address to connect to the website or other resource youâ€™ve requested.

Basically trough the **Domain name system** users are able to see the human-readable domain names instead of complex IP addresses. 
DNS translates domain names to ip address so browser can load the internet resource.
