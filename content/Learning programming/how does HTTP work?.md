HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a website, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource youâ€™ve requested. The server then sends an HTTP response back to the client, containing the requested data.
