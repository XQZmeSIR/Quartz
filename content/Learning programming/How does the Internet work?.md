Q. What is Internet at a high level?
?
A. It is an abundance of connected devices that are bound to each other using standardized protocols. Protocols define how the info is transmitted, security, and reliability. When you send data over the internet it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router.
