<div style="column-count: 2; text-align: left;"> These problems offer a range of difficulty levels to help you practice and solidify your understanding of while loops in Python. Remember to focus on the logic and the iterative process involved in solving each problem. Good luck, and have fun coding! 3. - Ask the user to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence.
